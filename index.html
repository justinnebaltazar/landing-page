            <div class="quote">In 2017, Charles Leclerc lost his father and in his final days, he told his father a white lie. That he'd made it to Formula 1; 
                that he'd signed the contract. It wasn't true then but his driving has made it true now, and look what he’s done with the opportunity. 
                The grandstands he saw built as a kid growing up now rise for him and for the first time in 93 years this fabled race is won by one of their own.
                Charles Leclerc wins the Monaco grand prix to achieve his dream.
